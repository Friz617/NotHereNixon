 USA_tricky_dick_desc:0 "President Nixon was nicknamed 'Tricky Dick' by the opposition due to his frequent political trickery, whether that is deceitful PR or behind-the-doors deals. Truth is, the naysayers aren't entirely wrong on that one.\nBut is that so bad ? After all, we're just playing the game. But politics has winners and losers, and we need to make sure that we don't fall into the latter category. We need to maneuver carefully if we want to stay on top while avoiding backlash from the public.\n\n\n§tNixon's Crookness§! : [?USA.nixon_crookness]\n\n§CPublic Perception§! : [?USA.nixon_public_perception]\n\n"

 usa_nixon.1.d:0 "Security guards at the Watergate complex, where the Democratic Party's headquarters are located, have arrested some innocent plumbers that were merely doing their job. The democrats have accused said plumbers of being undercover agents who's job was to wiretap their offices.\nOf course, President Nixon does not believe such blatant lies. But let's imagine, hypothetically, that these potentially fake plumbers were Nixon's men sent to spy on the opposition. That would be pretty bad for us wouldn't it ? Let's just hope that the investigators don't have such a creative imagination."

 usa_nixon.2.d:0 "The libs and other commies we're out to get us ! Making stuff up, calling us 'corrupted' or 'immoral' or some other bullshit. Thankfully, the truth, Nixon's truth, has prevailed. We've managed to calm the people down and convince them of Nixon's innocence. After all, who could doubt our benevolent President Nixon ?"

 usa_nixon.3.t:0 "Richard Nixon Resigns"
 usa_nixon.3.d:0 "Today, at 9PM (Eastern Time), President Richard Nixon made an address to the American public from the Oval Office to announce his resignation as President of the United States. Nixon's resignation is the culmination of what he referred to in his speech as the "long and difficult period of Watergate", a scandal that hit the President just a month ago. Due to this affair, Nixon faced almost certain impeachment and removal from office.\n\nAccording to his address, Nixon said he was resigning because "I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the nation would require". Nixon also stated his hope that, by resigning, "I will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in America." Nixon acknowledged that some of his judgments "were wrong," and he expressed contrition, saying: "I deeply regret any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision." He made no mention, however, of the articles of impeachment pending against him.\n\nVice-President Spiro Agnew is expected to be sworn in as soon as possible."

 usa_nixon.4.t:0 "Making A Public Statement"
 usa_nixon.4.d:0 "It appears that our...practices have somewhat annoyed the people. Honestly I don't get why. Do they really think that I got into this office by playing fair and square and telling the truth. Anyway, since we're apparently a democracy I can't just ignore them and I need to do something about it or they'll want to impeach me or something.\n\nI've had this brillant idea of talking to them, after all, it's not like I'm gonna be lying or anything. Now, the question is what media will I use to make my statement ?"

That should be enough to keep the people who vote for me satisfied. I just need to be convincing enough.\nBut what should I say ? The bigger the lie, the bigger the risk of the people catching on. But on the other hand, high risks mean high rewards."

 usa_nixon.8.d:0 "Today, at 9PM (Eastern Time), President Richard Nixon made an address to the American public from the Oval Office to apologize for everything he had done, for how crooked he had become. During his entire presidency, he had done nothing but trickery. He had tricked the opposition, he had tricked the people, he had tricked his fellow republicans...\nBut now, he had gone past all of that. He was a new man, an honest one, one that would focus on one thing and one thing only :his duty as President of the United States of America.\n\nThe entire nation was moved by that speech. It wasn't the usual empty talk. This time, the President sounded sincere.\nThe speech ended, and everyone clapped.\nGod bless the United States of America. God bless President Richard Nixon."
 usa_nixon.8.a:0 "It's time to turn over a new leaf"
 usa_nixon.8.b:0 "Damn, what was I on during that speech ?"
 usa_nixon.9.t:0 "Nixon Becomes The Ultimate Crook"
 usa_nixon.9.d:0 "Today, at 9PM (Eastern Time), President Richard Nixon ascended to a new plane of existence. He is now longer subject to human concepts such as morals. These things mean nothing to a God, and that's what Richard Nixon is now.\nThe United States is now nothing more than Nixon's playground.\n\n'But what about the public ?'\nPublic opinion is irrelevant. Nothing matters in the face of the all-powerful being that is Richard Nixon. The public itself is a now just a mere part of Nixon's greater consciousness.\n\nGod will not bless the United States of America. For God is Nixon, and Nixon is the United States."
